### 2. Overall Description

**2.1 User Needs**

Users of Audacity require software that is both powerful and easy to use with capabilities ranging from basic recording to advanced audio manipulation. Key needs include:

A user-friendly interface that simplifies complex editing tasks.

A wide range of editing features and effects to handle different audio projects.

Efficient performance for quick editing and processing.

Accessibility features to ensure usability by individuals with disabilities.

Software requirements are not limited to the listed key needs, but they are basic and most important requirements. Users intended to perform audio manipulations often look for powerful, but simple software that will allow them to record, trim, speed up or slow down, reverb audio tracks. Audacity is not limited to these functionalities. Moreover it provides many more tools to manipulate tracks. Considering the opportunity to install third-party plugins, the number of functionalities increases drastically. 

**2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies**

It is assumed that users have a basic understanding of audio editing concepts. 

The software's performance is dependent on the user's hardware capabilities and limitations.

Cross-platform functionality assumes compatibility with standard operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.


### 3. System Features and Requirements
**3.1 Functional Requirements**

Recording: Users must be able to connect a microphone or other audio input devices and record audio directly within the software. The recording feature should support multiple channels for users to manage different audio sources simultaneously.

Playback: The software shall provide playback functionality to review recordings or edits. Users should have the ability to control playback speed and loop sections for detailed editing and analysis.

Editing Tools: Comprehensive editing capabilities, including cutting, trimming, copying, and pasting, are essential. Advanced features such as fade in/out, silence, and time-stretch should also be available to handle a variety of editing needs.

Effects and Plugins: Audacity should offer a range of built-in audio effects like equalization, compression, reverb, and noise reduction. Support for third-party plugins in VST, AU, and LADSPA formats will enable users to extend the software’s functionality further.

File Formats: The software must support importing and exporting various audio file formats including WAV, MP3, OGG, and FLAC to ensure users can work with files from different sources and distribute their work in widely compatible formats.

**3.2 External Interface Requirements**

Audio Interfaces: Compatibility with a variety of audio input and output devices including USB microphones, audio interfaces, and built-in computer microphones is required. The software should seamlessly integrate with these devices without the need for additional configuration.

File Systems: Audacity must be able to interact with different file systems for file management, supporting operations like opening, saving, and organizing audio files across platforms.

**3.3 System Features**

Multi-Language Support: The software shall offer interface localization in multiple languages to cater to a global user base. This includes not just the GUI elements but also help documentation and support resources.

Theme Support: Customizable themes to enhance user experience by allowing users to personalize the look and feel of the software. This includes options for light, dark, and system-default themes.

Zoom and Scroll: Easy navigation through audio tracks via zoom and scroll features is critical for efficient editing. Users should be able to zoom in for detailed edits and scroll through long tracks without lag.

**3.4 Nonfunctional Requirements**

Intuitiveness: The interface and functionality should be intuitive for users of all experience levels, with a learning curve that accommodates both beginners and advanced users. Examples of intuitive design include contextual toolbars and drag-and-drop functionality for ease of use.

Reliability: Includes auto-save and backup features to prevent data loss during unexpected shutdowns or software crashes. The software should also be able to recover previous sessions in case of an unexpected closure.

Security: Ensures data protection and privacy through permission checks and secure handling of user data. This involves encrypting user sessions and safeguarding against unauthorized access to audio files.

Performance: Efficient use of system resources, supporting multi-core processing and optimized memory management to handle large projects without significant slowdowns. The software should be responsive and able to perform complex operations without excessive loading times.

### 4. Technical Constraints

Open Source: The software is open-source, relying on community contributions for ongoing development. This requires the software to be designed with modularity and clarity in mind, to facilitate contributions from developers around the world. The open-source nature also implies that Audacity must adhere to specific licenses for both the software itself and any third-party libraries it uses, which can limit the selection of available resources.

Cross-Platform Dependencies: Must address compatibility and dependency issues across supported operating systems. This involves ensuring that all features and functionalities are consistently available and performant on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Special attention must be paid to the testing and maintenance of these cross-platform capabilities, as differences in OS architectures and file systems can introduce challenges.

### 5. Other Requirements
Community Engagement: A feedback system for users to suggest improvements, report bugs, and contribute to the software's development is essential for fostering a vibrant community around Audacity. This system should be accessible directly within the software or via an official website, and include mechanisms for tracking the status of submitted feedback.

Documentation: Comprehensive and accessible documentation is crucial for users and developers alike. This includes user manuals, developer guides, and API documentation. The documentation should be maintained up-to-date with the software's features and be available in multiple languages to serve the global user base.

Accessibility: Audacity must adhere to accessibility standards to ensure it is usable by individuals with disabilities. This includes support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and customizable interface elements (such as font sizes and color contrasts) to accommodate various needs.

Training and Support: Offer resources for training and support to assist users in maximizing the software’s potential. This could include tutorial videos, forums for community support, and dedicated channels for technical assistance.

Quality Assurance: Implement a robust quality assurance process, including automated testing, continuous integration (CI), and manual testing by dedicated QA teams. This process should aim to catch bugs early and ensure software stability and reliability.

Legal Compliance: Ensure compliance with legal requirements related to software development and distribution. This includes data protection laws, copyright laws, and any other regulations relevant to audio software.

Sustainability: The development and operation of Audacity should consider environmental sustainability, minimizing the software's carbon footprint. This can involve optimizing the efficiency of the code to reduce energy consumption during use.

Innovation: Encourage innovation within the development community by supporting experimental features and plugins. A sandbox environment could be provided for users to try out new ideas without affecting the stability of the main software.

By addressing these technical constraints and other requirements, Audacity can continue to evolve as a leading open-source audio editing software, meeting the needs of its diverse user base while fostering a strong and engaged community.
