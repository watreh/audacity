# Audacity Software - Simplified Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document

## Introduction

This document is a guide on what Audacity is capable of. Audacity is free open-source audio editing software. We're aiming for an easy-to-use yet powerful tool for creators of all levels to record, edit, and manipulate audio.

### Purpose
The goal of this document is to outline the essential functionalities and requirements of Audacity, ensuring developers and stakeholders are on the same page regarding the software's capabilities, performance, and usability.

### Intended Audience
This SRS is meant for the development team, project managers, testers, potential contributors, and any individual curious about what the Audacity is supposed to do.

### Scope of the Software
Audacity should serve as a multi-track audio recorder and editor that can handle everything from quick audio trimming to substantial multi-track mixing. It will support various file formats, effects, and real-time processing features suitable for podcasters, musicians and audio professionals alike.

## Overall Description

### Product Perspective
Audacity is one of the best editors for audio tasks â€“ flexible enough to be used by beginners for simple recording tasks and by audio editors who need to conjure up complex editing.

### User Needs
